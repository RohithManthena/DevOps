Question - 3
I did not properly understand what Ascending / Descending means in terms of filenames as it was not mentioned, so I just assumed it to be the last update for the file. i.e. the last updated file comes first in the order of execution.
Also, I tested this is my local machine and I choose the home directory to be "D:"
